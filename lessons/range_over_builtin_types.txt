Range Over Builtin Types

If a type implements Iterable interface, we can range over it. All data structures in std.collection
implement that interface. Therefore we can use for loop to iterate over their elements.










Range over Array.



Range over ArrayList. You shouldnt modify the size of the ArrayList during iteration, because
that invalidates iterators.


We use pattern matching to decompose value into 'key' and 'value'. Same note as in ArrayList, we
shouldnt add elements during iteration.


Same note as in previous examples.
