Multiple Return Values

If you need to return multiple values from a function you can use tuples, and pattern matching.

Return type of this function is a tuple consisting of two Ints.



Using pattern matching we can decompose tuple to seperate variables of type int.


We can use the wildcard _ to match any value, if we dont need to use the value.
