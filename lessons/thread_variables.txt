Thread Variables

You can use ThreadLocal in the core package to create 
and use thread local variables.each thread can safely 
access its own thread local variables without being 
affected by other threads.

ThreadLocal variable initialization.
.get() returns Option<T>

Set value of variable a to 123.
Print that value.
Wait for the second thread to set value of a.
Print the same unchanged value.




Change value of a during the time first thread is running.






As we can see, truly, the variable a is local to each thread.
