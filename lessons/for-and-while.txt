For and while loops

Cangjie has both while and for loops

while the condition enclosed remains true, the loop runs


for loop =>  j iterates 0 through to 3 exclusive


for loop =>  j iterates 0 through to 3 inclusive








Cangjie uses pattern matching to iterate through the array




loop that only runs on values of j when the where condition is satisfied


when the iterator variable is not of concern, use the wildcard variable "_" to iterate the loop
