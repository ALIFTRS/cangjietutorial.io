Interfaces

An interface is used to define an abstract type. An interface contains no data but can define a behavior of a type. If a type declares that it implements an interface it must implement all member functions.


An interface can contain the following members:

Member function
Operator overloading function
Member property
These members are abstract. Implementing types must have the corresponding implementation of the members.



Here any class that implements interface Ia , must declare and define function f.

A class can implement multiple interfaces seperated by & as seen with class C
