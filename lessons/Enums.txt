Enums

Enums in cangjie are preceded by the enum keyword, and define all possible values of the type.

When match is used on an enum, it must cover all constructors of the enum type to be matched.

Identifiers can be shared between Enum constructors and other variables/functions/classes, but care must be taken to differentiate between them.

Additionally, constructors within Enums can be overloaded as well, here Green and Green(UInt8) can both be defined since they have a different number of parameters.





Enum definitions can be recursive, an example is given here where we use Expr to define the constructors within Expr.






The examples at the end of the main function show common examples for when a specification needs to be made.
