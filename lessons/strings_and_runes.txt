Strings And Runes

Strings in Cangjie are arrays of runes underneath. Runes can represent any
character in Unicode set.



Type inference from string literal.

String has a instance variable size, which is equal to number of Runes in the
string.


We can access individual runes of the string using [] notation. Indexing is 
obviously from 0.



We can also do extended loop over elements of string, where i becomes the value
of each rune. 





Rune literals are preceded with an r, and enclosed with single quatation mark.
