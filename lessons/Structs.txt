Structs

The following examples illustrate how to define structs.
The Rectangle struct has 2 member variables, cangjie supports overloading for common constructors as shown.


Structs also accept a maximum of one primary constructor, that has the same name as the struct type.

Both recursive and mutually recursive structs are invalid.
