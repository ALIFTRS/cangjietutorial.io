Generic Functions

Generic functions can by created by adding type parameter after the functions name.

To enforce certain type constraints you use 'where' syntax.
You write what classes or interfaces type substituted for T 
has to inherit/implement. 















We can use this function on Int64, becuase it implements Comparable<Int64> 
interface.





We can also use the same function with Strings.
