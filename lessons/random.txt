Random

The random packages generates pseudo random numbers. The random class sets a seed in
which it uses to generate random numbers, instance with the same seed will generate the 
same numbers. By default the seed is randomly generated, therefore if you do not initialise
the seed yourself the code execution will be different upon every execution.



Here, the seed is manually set to 3 and thus repeated execution of the code
results in the same "random" numbers
